# Big Data Assignment README

This README file provides instructions on how to execute the project, including all Docker commands used and an overview of the project's structure.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `dockerfile`: Dockerfile for building the Docker image.
- `load.py`: Python script for loading the dataset and running preprocessing tasks.
- `dpre.py`: Python script for data preprocessing.
- `vis.py`: Python script for data visualization.
- `model.py`: Python script containing functions for K-means clustering.
- `final.ps1`: PowerShell script for copying output files from the Docker container to the local machine and stopping the container.
- `service-result/`: Directory containing output files generated by the project, including results of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and clustering.

## Execution Instructions

### 1. Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
docker build -t bd-a1-image .
```

### 2. Running the Docker Container

To run the Docker container, execute the following command:

```bash
docker run -it --name bd-a1-container bd-a1-image
```

### 3. Executing the Project

Once inside the Docker container, execute the following command to run the project:

```bash
python3 load.py <path_to_dataset>
```

Replace `<path_to_dataset>` with the path to your dataset file.

### 4. Stopping the Docker Container

After executing the project, stop the Docker container by running:

```bash
exit
```

## Docker Commands Used

- `docker build`: Used to build the Docker image from the Dockerfile.
- `docker run`: Used to run the Docker container from the built image.
- `docker exec`: Used to execute commands inside a running Docker container.
- `docker cp`: Used to copy files from the Docker container to the local machine.
- `docker stop`: Used to stop a running Docker container.
